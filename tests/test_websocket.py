"""WS /ws/stream smoke test — the browser->WS contract, in-process.

Drives the real FastAPI app with Starlette's TestClient: sends a `config` message and raw
int16 PCM frames the way the receiver browser tab does, and asserts the server reassembles
them into analysis windows and streams back `score` events.

The handler drops stale analysis windows when inference can't keep up, so under a burst it
may emit fewer events than windows (each carries `dropped`); paced at ~real time it emits
one per window.
